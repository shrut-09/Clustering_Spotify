# Clustering_Spotify
This Project aims at using K-means Clustering Model on Spotify data. K-means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm which identifies K number of centroids and assing every data point to its nearest cluster.
Spotify API enables us to extract data from "https://developer.spotify.com" using Spotipy Library.
After clusters are generated we can notice features which are dominant in each cluster and the basis of clustering can be easily identified.
Spotipy is a python library used to extract data from Spotify API (Application Programming Interface)
Spotify API helps the developers to extract its data easily for various collaborations and projects.
